- name: MasterCard - Get Block
  x-api-slug: block-get
  description: |-
    By default, this call returns the last confirmed block, since the `from`
    and `to` parameters will both default to the last confirmed slot number.
    To get a range of blocks, use the `from` and `to` parameters. Specifying
    only the `from` parameter will get a range of blocks up to the current slot.
    Note that this also means that specifying `to` without `from` will result
    in an error since that will mean a negative range.

    For each returned item, the data will contain header information from
    the block binary, and references to the block entries via the merkle roots.

    Note that the maximum range request allowed is 600 entries.
