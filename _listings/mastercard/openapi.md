      description: |-
        When you are permissioned onto the network, you will be issued one or
        more `id`s to use. You may then send or update configurations of the
        transaction message types you wish to use. These are specified using
        Protocol Buffer version 3 files as specified
        [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
        This specification may be sent either as the canonical JSON transform
        or the native `.proto` file encoded as hex, base58 or base64.

  /address/{address}:
    get:
      summary: Get Address Address
      description: |-
        Information about a particular address on the network. Note that this
        call may return information about a blockchain node or a signing entity.
        Also, the level of detail returned will vary depending on your permissions
        for the query target.

  /block:
    get:
      summary: Get Block
      description: |-
        By default, this call returns the last confirmed block, since the `from`
        and `to` parameters will both default to the last confirmed slot number.
        To get a range of blocks, use the `from` and `to` parameters. Specifying
        only the `from` parameter will get a range of blocks up to the current slot.
        Note that this also means that specifying `to` without `from` will result
        in an error since that will mean a negative range.

        For each returned item, the data will contain header information from
        the block binary, and references to the block entries via the merkle roots.

        Note that the maximum range request allowed is 600 entries.
